# esp32-synth

My thesis - monophonic synthesizer based od ESP32. Everything is based on real-time calculating samples and sending them to DAC output. Sythesizer have implemented 5 waves, AM and FM modulation, ASR envelope, arpeggiator and analog low-cut filter. 
Instead of classic keyboard, synth use ILI9341 touchscreen to play notes.
